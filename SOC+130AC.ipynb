Here is the list of all of the census tracts and in every column is a data type that you collected. Right now, the data is sorted by the column 'cigarette butts found' in descending order. To change how it is sorted, simply change the column name to the column you want to sort it by, i.e. 'children playing'. Make sure the name of the column is in quotes! Also, if you want it in ascending order, change the descending to ascending. Also, you can change the amount of results it returns by changing the number inside the list command.\n",

This is not a very statistical measure of how much a variable correlates to the results. What does it mean for a variable \"income\" to match 7 out of the top 15 neighborhood points? Does this correlate to the rest of the results? How well does it correlate? We will now use a method called linear regression to make a graph that will show the best fit line that correlates to the data. The variable \"r squared\" is a measure of how close the data is to the fitted regression line. 0 means the variable explains none of the variability of the data while 1 means it explains all of the variability in the data.\n",

    "Why is this a better method than just sorting tables? First of all, we are now comparing all of the data in the graph to the variable, rather than comparing what our eyes glance quickly over. It shows a more complete picture than just saying \"There are some similar results in the top half of the sorted data\". Second of all, the graph gives a more intuitive sense to see if your variable does match the data. You can quickly see if the data points match up with the regression line. Lastly, the r-squared value will give you a way to quantify how good the variable is to explain the data."

No wonder it's difficult to get the whole picture! We will now use multiple regression to use 2(or 3) variables to make our model even more accurate. Try changing up the column names to see close your regression line is now!"
