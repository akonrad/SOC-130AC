Does this correlate to the rest of the results? We will now use a method called linear regression to make a graph that will show the best fit line that correlates to the data.

It shows a more complete picture than just saying \"There are some similar results in the top half of the sorted data\". Second of all, the graph gives a more intuitive sense to see if your variable does match the data. You can quickly see if the data points match up with the regression line. Lastly, the r-squared value will give you a way to quantify how good the variable is to explain the data."
