This is not a very statistical measure of how much a variable correlates to the results. What does it mean for a variable \"income\" to match 7 out of the top 15 neighborhood points? Does this correlate to the rest of the results? How well does it correlate? We will now use a method called linear regression to make a graph that will show the best fit line that correlates to the data. The variable \"r squared\" is a measure of how close the data is to the fitted regression line. 0 means the variable explains none of the variability of the data while 1 means it explains all of the variability in the data.\n",

You can change the column name like in the previous code to change the x axis. The graph will give you a better sense of the whole data rather than just sorting columns like you did above. The R-squared value will give you an exact \"goodness-of fit\" value for your model. \n",

    "Why is this a better method than just sorting tables? First of all, we are now comparing all of the data in the graph to the variable, rather than comparing what our eyes glance quickly over. It shows a more complete picture than just saying \"There are some similar results in the top half of the sorted data\". Second of all, the graph gives a more intuitive sense to see if your variable does match the data. You can quickly see if the data points match up with the regression line. Lastly, the r-squared value will give you a way to quantify how good the variable is to explain the data."
