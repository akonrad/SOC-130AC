Albeit vacant lots were not the most salient use of space within the block face, I noticed 5 of them as I was walking around. Vacant lots are signs of areas where houses used to be, but are no longer there due to neglect or inability to keep a house standing there. Vacant lots are fairly common in the poorer areas of cities, which West Oakland can strongly be considered. Vacant lots are sometimes used as places to dispose of garbage or unwanted household items, similar to this mattress that was disposed of on the side of the street. I noticed that all of the vacant lots that I saw had a myriad of old chairs, mattresses, and piles of garbage surrounding the area. ","Although West Oakland is notoriously a more dangerous neighborhood with a shortage of economic resources, there is certainly not a shortage of community. While doing my observations, I saw that everyone who walked by one another all said hello. The groups of teenagers who were walking around were not being deviant or fighting, they were just walking calmly as friends. I also noted a lot of inspiring signs, as well as positive political graffiti messages, portraying a strong sense of being there for one another. The first photo is a house that has signs in the window with drawings done by a child, which writes, “I’m Human”, along with another sign that states “Black Lives Matter”. The second photo is a sign that says “Neighborhood Watch, We immediately report all suspicious activities to the Oakland PD. We look out for each other!” I thought this photo was a strong representation of this neighborhood because although this neighborhood can be dangerous, the residents living within this community are there for one another. The last photo that I chose is a photo capturing a political message carried out by art, that reads “Prosperity happens through cooperative economics”. I found this to be representative of the neighborhood for it shows that the members of this neighborhood want to control the economics of the neighborhood, build their own businesses, and share the wealth provided, showing a sense of willingness to improve their neighborhood; there is high collective efficacy.

When standing in front of the home on Shattuck Avenue, almost none of the house could be seen because of this large rock in the front yard.

It was also interesting to me because there was no visible construction happening on the street or exterior of the nearby houses so possibly a home had just been redone or there were some interior renovations being done.,"This area is within the property of Wittier School we can see that the schools in this area are highly funded as we can see a large playground in back, basketball hoops to the back left and they even have their own garden which we can see in the foreground. ",This was taken in front of one of the houses on Francisco Street and there were several houses that I saw that had signs similar to these posted in front of their house. Since the area has a lot of school it could be used to keep teenagers and kids away from messing with their families but I suspect that since down Shattuck a couple blocks is BART which always has homeless people loitering around it’s their attempt to keep away the homeless from their nicer neighborhood.,This picture was taken on Shattuck in front of a restaurant that specialized in cuisine from Southern Italy. This stuck out to me because in parts of Berkeley you see stores and restaurants with bars on their windows or tall fences to protect the buildings but this one had a classic Italian car sitting right in front of the store.
