    "Eyeballing patterns is not the same as a statisical measure of a correlation; you must quantify it with numbers and statistics to prove your thoughts. This is not a very statistical measure of how much a variable correlates to the results. What does it mean for a variable \"income\" to match 7 out of the top 15 social disorder points? Does this correlate to the rest of the results? How well does it correlate? \n",
    "\n",
    "We will now use a method called linear regression to make a graph that will show the best fit line that correlates to the data. The slope of the line will show whether it is positively correlated or negatively correlated. The variable \"r squared\" is a measure of how close the data is to the fitted regression line. 0 means the variable explains none of the variability of the data while 1 means it explains all of the variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to plot the change in Points with respect to a certain variable(like education or income). Therefore, the Y axis will always be social disorder and the X axis will be the variable that we want to analyze. Right now, the x variable is set to \"Income\". The graph will give you a better sense of the whole data rather than just sorting columns like you did above. The R-squared value will give you an exact \"goodness-of fit\" value for your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "To change the X axis, you need to change the x variable from \"Income\" to either \"Education\" or \"Employment\" (or another one of the census variables). Make sure you don't delete the quotation marks and remember to capitalize the first letter!\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this a better method than just sorting tables? First of all, we are now comparing all of the data in the graph to the variable, rather than comparing what our eyes glance quickly over. It shows a more complete picture than just saying \"There are some similar results in the top half of the sorted data\". Second of all, the graph gives a more intuitive sense to see if your variable does match the data. You can quickly see if the data points match up with the regression line. Lastly, the r-squared value will give you a way to quantify how good the variable is to explain the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the beautiful things about computer science and statistics is that you do not need to reinvent the wheel. You don't need to know how to calculate the r_squared value, or draw the regression line; someone has already implemented it! You simply need to tell the computer to calculate it. However, if you are interested in these mathematical models, take a data science or statistics course!"

    "    \n",
    "1)We observed the data on a map where we could click on various points and see the data. This gives an intuitive sense of how the data is spread out across different census tracts and what we can expect from our analyses. Having a physical picture of what the data could possibly be representing is often a good first step rather than jumping straight into the numbers.\n",

    "2)We observed the data in table form. As nice as graphs are, it is not possible to sort a graph. Therefore, we turned our graph into table form, compressed the data, and looked for correlation between known statistics. It is an important part of to compare your collected results to known statistics. There is no point in collecting data if you cannot measure it against some standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Instead of eyeballing the table, we now created a graph and computed the line of best fit. We also got an r_squared value which measured the correlation.
